Implementation of [Shadowsocks 2022](https://github.com/Shadowsocks-NET/shadowsocks-specs/blob/main/2022-1-shadowsocks-2022-edition.md) written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org).

Shadowsocks 2022 is an encrypted proxy protocol utilizing a pre-shared key and was designed to be hard to detect to avoid government censorship.

Work in progress and does not fully conform yet.
